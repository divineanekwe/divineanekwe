<h2>🧠 Background & Interests</h2>

I hold a degree in Biochemistry and have led research on plant-based anti-sickling agents. My experience caring for a dementia patient inspired my passion for mental health and AI-driven solutions in healthcare. I’m currently transitioning into tech with a strong interest in solving real-world problems through software and data science.
